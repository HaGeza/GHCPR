# GitHub Commit Proportion Reporter (GHCPR)

This is a GitHub action, that creates a plot based on the proportion of commits on the current branch made by each user, adds it to the specified file (`README.md` by default), ammends the commit, and pushes the changes.

The main use-case for this tool are repos with log-normal-like commit-proportion-distributions ðŸ˜‰.
