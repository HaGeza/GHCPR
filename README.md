# GitHub Commit Proportion Reporter (GHCPR)

This is a GitHub action, that creates a plot based on the proportion of commits on the current branch made by each user, adds it to the specified file (`README.md` by default), creates a new commit, and pushes the changes. Since the action creates a new commit, it is recommended to run it manually with `workflow_dispatch`, instead of on each push.
